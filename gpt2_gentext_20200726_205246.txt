Rachel: Hi!
Monica: Hey, Phoebe! Here you go.
Rachel: Why?
Phoebe: I have a question that Ive been wondering about your parents.
Rachel: Oh?
Phoebe: Ive had a lot of questions about your parents. You can ask them questions

Phoebe: Well, theyre about things like your parents.
Rachel: Yes!
Phoebe: Theyre aboutâ€¦

that youre really sorry about.

Phoebe: Well, I dont know yet. I mean, I know youre probably gonna be
already married by now.

Phoebe: Okay, fine, fine. The good thing is, we dont have a problem.
Rachel: Okay.
Phoebe: Okay. (They kiss and Rachel kisses again.)
Rachel: Thank you.
Phoebe: (she takes the kiss) The bad thing is, when I said the right answer, I

really dont want to hear it.
Rachel: Oh, okay.
Phoebe: Okay.
====================
Joey: You had to read the whole thing to find out.
Ross: Oh yeah, I think it was pretty well written.
Joey: Oh yeah?
Ross: Oh yeah?
Joey: Now there was one problem. I think I just spent the whole thing
putting out the flyers.
(Joey looks at Ross and gives him a thumbs up.)
Joey: Okay, Pheebs, I'm gonna go talk to you later, all right?
(She leaves, but Joey bursts into the living room.)
Ross: So, what's going on?
Joey: Oh, its just that Joey is very into this woman, and she doesnt
like him. Well, that doesnt mean she doesnt like him either, right?
Well, she doesnt like him and wants to spend the rest of her life
sullying under a bridge.
Ross: Yeah, okay, give me a break, I'll be right back.
(Joey leaves.)
Ross: Well, so, what are you gonna do?
Joey: I don't know.
Ross: Well, you can talk to her, you can kiss her, you can
be in the same room with her.
Joey: Okay! Okay! (They both run out into the hallway.)

Mike: I don't know.
Rachel: Mike, you have to find Joey.
Mike: Well, I don't know.
Rachel: Oh, then why don't you say Joe?
Mike: I don't know. I mean, I hate myself for saying it, but the way I see it, my drinking problem is over.

Mike: So, here's a cup of coffee.
Rachel: No, I'm not just gonna

Ross: Oh, you-you dont have to know this, but some people do.
Joey: (shaking his head) Okay, I have to give you a hint,
'cause Ive never seen him throw three balls in a row through a hole like this.
Ross: Yeah, that would be great.
Joey: Yeah, you dont have to give me that hint.
Ross: Ohhhh, no-no-no, no-no-no, I-I-I-I have no clue, cause Ive never
wondered this before, but this is something different. I had to throw you a
few things, and you threw a lot of them.
Joey: (entering) Hey, can I-I-I just talk to you?
Ross: Yeah, sure.
Joey: Okay, okay, that is it, dont worry about it.
Ross: All right, see ya. (Runs out.)
[Monica enters at the door.]
Monica: I just saw this guy who was just like running around with this big guy,
he didnt think he could get away with it, and he just kept on running.
Ross: What?
Monica: He just ran up and down the aisle, kissed a guy, and then he left. I
just wish he didnt know that I was crying.
Ross: Thats funny, Ive been crying too.
Monica: And then I got to see this big guy with the big beard.
[Joey enters, carrying two pizzas.]
Ross: Youre welcome, but I would like to see if I could make a little extra.

watching TV.
Joey: No, I got it.
Ross: Okay, now, we just get out of here for a second, and then you will have a little
more time to get to know this guy and get to know the foods that Im eating.
Joey: Okay, if I hadnt already seen
====================
Ross: I am not going to lie to you,
i.e. most people do not tell the truth. 
Chandler: Well, look, just because youve got the
truth doesn't mean you should lie to people.
Ross: (sarcastically) Well, if you dont tell the truth, you
haven't lied to anyone in your life.
Chandler: Well, it was you.
Ross: Yeah, I got my facts wrong.
Chandler: I know. I can show you how to lie!
(Ross laughs and walks out.)

====================
He was so excited about this, that he started taking these tiny little vials and pouring out.
Monica: What's this?
Chandler: He had to turn the bowl into a pot, because the museum didn't want to have that space.
Monica: Oh my God! How did you do that?
Cleverbot: Because your picture would only be on the wall.
Chandler: Well, we-we just had to find a place for it.
Monica: Oh my God. What are you doing?
Cleverbot: We're just trying to make it as special as possible for the museum.
Monica: What are you doing?
Cleverbot: Well, I-I think it's a good idea to give the museum a go.
Monica: Okay. (they walk into the museum) Hey guys!
Chandler: Can I talk to you for a second?
Monica: (pause) Yeah, okay. (they walk into the bathroom) And umm, there you go.
Chandler: (To Monica) You-you have a smaller penis.
Monica: And I have the greatest daydreams.
Chandler: My penis is smaller than yours.
Monica: No! No at all. No! I mean, you have to be in the museum at all times, and you have to be there.
Chandler: Okay, you have to be in the museum.
Monica: Okay, but I have a really big dream coming up.
Chandler: I don't wanna go to the museum, but you have to try. (pause) You have to try, you have to try, and try, and try.
Monica: Okay, keep trying.
Chandler: I don't know what to do.
Monica: Okay.
(Chandler tries to take the vials out of the museum, but they just sit there.)
Chandler: Let me see this. (Walks away)
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is still trying to get Monicas attention, and Rachel is getting a little more upset.]
Rachel: I think you should tell her what you're doing.
Monica: What?
Rachel: I don't think she's gonna like you right now.
Monica:
====================
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Chandler is sitting on the couch, eating a cookie.]
Monica: I love this cookie! (She takes a bite, but she can't finish it.)
Chandler: Its so good. I thought I got it with one of those actual, real cookies.
Monica: (browsing the cookie) I think this is probably the best thing you have ever had in my face.
Chandler: Oh, I know! I have had it in my mouth for years! I have cried every time I have had it, and I have cried so hard I almost lost my virginity. My aunt is an incredible woman, she really made me think about what I would do if I got married next.
Monica: I knew you had one in your mouth.
Chandler: I now have it in my mouth. (He takes the cookie and mumbles something) Oh my God!
Monica: I know, I know, but where did you get it from?
Chandler: It was in my mouth. (Monica looks at him)
Monica: What?!
Chandler: It was in my mouth like this. (She takes a bite, but she can't finish it.)
Monica: (browsing the cookie) I think this is probably the best thing you have ever had in my face.
Chandler: Oh, I know, I know, I know, but where did you get it from?
Monica: It was in my mouth. (She takes a bite)
[Scene: A restaurant. Joey is on his date with Phoebe and they're sitting opposite each other on a table.]
Joey: (sitting) Hey, how did you know about that little girl that I went out with earlier?
Phoebe: Oh, you know, I guess I figured I would just be a couple of friends and not be a couple of bats trying to jump out of my flat.
Joey: Oh no, no no no no no no no no no, you know, it would be a good idea. It would be a good idea.
Phoebe: Well, I guess I just have to be really good at this and then everything will be ok.
Joey: You know, I guess I have to do all this to make it not work
====================
[Scene: The Hallway, Joey is returning from the bathroom, Chandler enters]
Chandler: Hey! How was the Met?
Joey: Uhh, yesterday at the Met, I stole some money from Ross's account.
Chandler: Oh my God!
Joey: Well, it turns out that's not the point. The point is that I stole money from you.
Chandler: So, who are you?
Joey: Oh, well, I was wondering if you and I would go out sometime, but it's just that this is so hard. 
Chandler: What are you doing on your own?
Joey: Well, I'm going to the Met.
Chandler: That's ridiculous! You don't pay for this!
Joey: All right, well I'll see you guys later, all right?

Joey: Goodnight.
Chandler: Okay. (he takes off his coat)
Joey: Ow!
Chandler: What?!
Joey: Are you going to leave me alone with Ross?
Chandler: I thought you were going to go and steal the money from me.
Joey: Now that you're going away, why did Ross tell you?
Chandler: Because, I think he would be very upset about having to leave him alone with you.
Joey: Well, I thought you would go and steal the money from me.
Chandler: I did not think that you would go and steal the money from me.
Joey: Thank you. (they hug)
[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is reading off a list of things Rachel did for him.]
Joey: You know, I'm not always going to the right place.
Rachel: If you please.
Joey: Oh, I'm not writing that out.
Rachel: Okay. (he cradles her and licks her hand) What else?
Joey: I touched her hand.
Rachel: Oh Joey, y'know what? If you want to go to the Met, if you want to go to the Knicks, if you want to go to the Knicks, you can. 
Joey: I'm not going to the Met!
Rachel: I'm going to
====================
Joey: Yeah, well not for me. I'm just gonna make sure you know that.
Rachel: Okay.
Joey: You know what? I think I can handle this. I mean, I've been following Emma around all day and she's always been so cute and cute and weird and cute.
Rachel: (jumps at the chance to kiss him) All right, so how was Emma?
Joey: I am so cute.
Rachel: All right, fine, you're the best person I ever met. (She ignores Joey and goes to hug him.)
Joey: No, you're not. You're the best person I ever got. You're the best person I ever lost. You're the best person I ever had to see. You're the best person I ever had to take away. You're the best person I ever have.
Rachel: You actually have that, are you just going to hide it from me?
Joey: (sarcastic) No, I mean, I really mean it, you know, I mean, I just don't want to be the one who has to see it, I mean I have to feel it.
Rachel: What?
Joey: I mean, I think I just don't want to go out with you, I mean, I just don't feel like I have to see it.
Rachel: What do you mean? You have to feel it?
Joey: I don't know. I mean, I don't think I have to.
Rachel: (goes back to the couch) You're the best person ever.
Joey: What?
Rachel: You're the best person I ever had. You're the best person I ever had to have. And I'm just going to hide it from you all day, okay?
Joey: (pause) No, I mean, you know, I can't tell you about it right now, but I'm going to call you tomorrow and tell you about it.
Rachel: All right, I'm going to call you. (She starts to walk away.)
Joey: Okay. (She stops and starts to walk away too.)

Joey: Why? Why? Why? Why?
Rachel: The only thing I can think of that makes me look good
====================
Joey: Hey, howd the audition go?
Rachel: Oh, that was my agent, Ross.
Joey: Ross?
Rachel: Oh, well, y'know, I was like, "Come on, come on, this is what audition looks like!"
Ross: (laughs) You're not just talking. You're serious.
Joey: (laughs) Yeah, I can't believe you're not serious.
Rachel: Oh, that's actually the point.
Joey: Okay, well, well, well see. (To Chandler) Why don't you go with Ross?
Chandler: Because I can't believe Ross's gonna be auditioning. 
Joey: (smiles) You're a real bitch.
Chandler: And we really have to get going.
(They walk to the door and Chandler opens it.)

Chandler: Not what I heard.
Joey: Oh, you're not going?
Chandler: No, but, you, you don't hear what I'm telling you.
Joey: Oh, well not for a long, long time. (Pause) You're gonna see.
(Chandler thinks for a while and then goes to the door)
Joey: (sighs) Wow! Umm, okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

Rachel: Yeah, but how funny?
Ross: Yeah, how funny?
Rachel: Well, so funny I can't believe I'm trying to tell you this story right now, so,

Ross: (sarcastically) Oh, you know what? I'm sorry.
Rachel: Yeah, I'm sorry.
Ross: I know.
Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to make it seem like
you're trying to find someone who's wrong, and not just, and not just
wrong for the wrong reason.
Ross: (sarcastic) Wrong with you?
Rachel: (laughs) No, I mean, you know it's, you're right. But, I mean
it's just, it's just, you know, for like, two weeks, and then I think, 'Oh my
God, I can't find someone.'
Ross: Really?
Rachel: Yeah, I mean, you'd think, if you're right, I'm gonna, I'm gonna
just, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna be like, like, like a, a little, a little, a
little, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna be a little less of a,
a little less, a little less of a, a little less of a, a little less of a, a little
nervous, and a little less of a big day.'

Rachel: Well, I'm sorry. I am, I am, I am sorry.
Ross: Really?
Rachel: Well, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Ross: (sarcastic) No, no, no, that's not it.
Rachel: No, you know, that's, that's not it. I mean, I'm sorry, I'm not
right for you, but I'm sorry.
Ross: Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I, I'm
====================
I'm gonna go tell you something.
Chandler: Well, I'm sure you'll be more than happy to get along, right?
Ross: Oh, come on!
Joey: Hey, you can't just go to the police.
Chandler: You know what? I can't believe I even tried to do anything wrong.
Joey: Look, I'm sorry. I just think you're too good to be true.
Chandler: I don't know what to say.
Joey: You're right. That's what I'm saying. I'm sorry.
Chandler: I mean, if you had behaved this way all those times before, you'd have been a little bit
different.
Joey: Yeah, but you can't go to the police.
Chandler: I can't go to the police.
Joey: What? If I wanna go to the police, why don't you tell her something?
Chandler: I can't go to the police.
Joey: Well, maybe if you tell her I'm this guy's girlfriend, she's gonna believe me.
Chandler: Well, I'm sorry, I just think you're a little crazy about me all the time.
Joey: Oh, you're not crazy?
Chandler: Well, maybe you are, I don't know. I mean, maybe you'd like to go out with me tonight,
maybe you'd like to go out with me to a movie, maybe you'd like to go out with someone who is somebody who
is totally capable of handling a lot of people, who is willing to take risks, who is able to take risks
and who is completely unflappable of criticism.
Joey: Hell of a movie, huh?
(Chandler and Joey are standing closer to the door, and as they pass Joey, he starts to get a little
dru
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is returning from their date.]
Ross: So, have you ever thought about going out with her?
Joey: No. Because, you know, I mean, she's not very pretty. She's not a blonde, and I'm not
up to the level of a college girl. She's kind of a loose cannon.
Chandler: Well, you don

Phoebe: Rachel?

Rachel: Well, not close, but close. 
Monica: So close. 
Rachel: Well, then I don't know if I can believe it. I mean, you and I
always had this weird bond. And I was like, "Okay, let's just forget it. We
can all go home and live together, we'll just have a little bit of a
breakfast." I mean, that's what I was hoping. 
Monica: Really? 
Rachel: Oh yeah! So when the fact that you and me first started dating,
I thought, "Oh my God, we should go out and have a little bit of a break.

Joey: Hey, you got to tell me why I'm doing this.
Rachel: Well, I don't know. I mean, I'm not really cool with it, you know, but you know, it's just so hard.

Phoebe: Do you know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking it's a little too weird.
Joey: Yeah, I - I think it's kind of weird.
Phoebe: I don't know, maybe it's the fact that I was so busy trying to make up for last. I mean, I was just so busy trying to get into this stupid party.
Joey: Oh, I was just trying to make up for not being able to come to a couple of parties last time.
Phoebe: Which is why I thought it was kinda cool that you were here.

Phoebe: Yeah, it's just we're-we're looking for a good guy, and he's the right guy for us, and we're just not in a good place right now.
Joey: Yeah, well you know what? I may have a date.
Phoebe: Yeah, the only good thing about you is that you're just trying to make life hell for me.
Joey: Oh, yeah, you are kind of a good guy.
Phoebe: (interrupts him) Oh-oh, why did I hear that? Why did I hear that?
Joey: I'm sorry. If I get a date with a guy like that, it's because I've got a two way street. (Phoebe grabs his coat and starts to drag him out of the apartment)

Joey: Youre not gonna be there.

Rachel: You're late, I've been playing!
Joey: Oh, look, I don't need any of you to help me. I'm going to the airport, and Geoffrey is going to pick me up for lunch.
Rachel: What the hell are you talking about? That's how late it's going to be in the airport!
Joey: Oh, don't worry. I'm gonna make it there by myself!
Rachel: Ooh, why do we even care? Just because we can't get to this flight doesn't mean we don't get to STFU!
Joey: I don't care. I'm going to pick you up at the gate!
Rachel: (To Geoffrey) I can't believe you've got to fly here with us. You've obviously got to make it to the bathroom before I can get to the bathroom, okay?
Gavin: You know the one.
Joey: I have to go over here to talk to you.
Gavin: But if we don't make it, you're going to be late!

Gavin: All right.
Rachel: You know, I think we should wait a while longer, Joe.
Joey: Wait a while longer, I wanna see you.
Rachel: Why?
Joey: Because I have to talk to you, okay? And I've been playing the game my entire life, I can't even go over there with you guys!
Gavin: Okay, fine, we're just gonna be here for a while.

I think you're, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, it's just hard, you know.
(They kiss again and Chandler tries to move away but he snaps and takes the kiss.)
Rachel: (laughs and grimaces) That's okay.
Ross: Yeah, well, I have to admit, I... I do, I have to admit that, you know, it's
really hard.
Rachel: Oh, Ross, you know what? I don't need it.
Ross: Yeah, I, I can't.

thing about Barry wearing underwear.
Phoebe: Really?
Joey: Really.
Phoebe and Joey:
Phoebe: What?!
Joey: Oh, I don't know.
Phoebe: Oh, you know, what's with you and me wearing underwear?
Joey: Well, I'm pretty sure I just thought of Barry wearing these.
Phoebe: Really?
Joey: Yeah, I just think that maybe it's just, you know, maybe that maybe its just,
he's not actually wearing them. I mean, maybe, maybe I should just just kiss him. 
Phoebe: Okay, but wait, what if you don't kiss him? I mean, maybe you kiss
him.
Joey: Oh, that's right, but I think I might kiss him right now.
Phoebe: (starts to kiss her) Really? Why don't you just kiss him right now?
Joey: (kisses her) Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Okay. Okay.
Phoebe: All right, Monica and Chandler are going to have to leave the apartment at
least Monday, and I think that's the only way I'm gonna have time to talk to you guys.
Joey: But y'know what, I should probably get to know you guys. Okay? I mean, the
only reason I'm leaving is because I'm having a really bad day.
Phoebe: Well, I'm not having a bad day.
Joey: What?!
Phoebe: No, no!
Joey: I saved your face!
Phoebe: You're right. I mean, I don't know how to talk to you guys right now!

my lips touched.
Monica: (starts to break down) What?

stopping by her apartment to see if she's still around.
Monica: All right, well, I think I'll see you there.
Joey: Yeah, I'll see.

Ross: Right, right.
Joey: And you got this, right there.
Chandler: No, but there was a button on the door, and we just had to
wait until they figured out what theyre doing.
Joey: No, no, no. No, I mean I thought it was a joke. I mean, it was
just a stupid thing that umm, maybe its not funny when you have to sleep
with people to be around you.
Chandler: Yes, but umm, she only had one eye.

Ross: Look, I'm not gonna tell you this other than I had a dream last night.
Rachel: What dream?
Ross: Yeah, I had a dream that this guy from school was going to be a teacher.
Rachel: Oh wow, he's not going to be a teacher, but he's gonna be a teacher and I was on the other team. 
Ross: What dream?
Rachel: Oh yeah, well... I woke up this morning and I was in the middle of the tunnel and I was thinking, Ooh, he's going to be my teacher.
Ross: Oh, God.
Rachel: So I took the train back to the museum, I went to the gate, and I saw this guy with a big, big bird in the guy's... 
Ross: He's my teacher.
Rachel: Oh, God. I thought that was my dream.
Ross: Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God, and I don't have a dream. I got a little carried away.
Rachel: Ohh, God. I'm just so glad that you're okay. You know, I'm not sure how to talk to you, but I'm just so glad that you're okay.
Ross: Really?
Rachel: I think I just broke up with you.
Ross: Oh wow, you broke up with me. Yeah, but you broke up with your boss.
Rachel: Hey, Ross, I don't have a boss.
Ross: No, I don't know how to talk to you, but I'm just so... 
Rachel: Oh, God, I don't know if you're aware, but I just can't seem to get out of bed.
Ross: I don't sleep on my own.
Rachel: Oh, it's not because I'm lazy. I mean, if my feet get cold I can still get your money. I mean, if I was getting your money I'd bet my ass that I'd never be cold. 
Ross: I'm not getting your money! That's a lie!
Rachel: Ross, you're not getting my money! I've already left my job offer, and I'm not getting my current job offer.
Ross: I can't believe I went through this myself! I mean, I've been through a lot, and it's not even a pretty picture.
====================
Monica: What are you doing here?
Ross: Just trying to be nice to you.
Rachel: Well, that is a nice thing, but you are a huge step
up...
Phoebe: Oh, and you don't have to work. We have a manager here.
Rachel: We have a manager here?
Phoebe: You mean, the guy who's gonna do the talking.
Rachel: Oh yeah, I know. Yeah, we used to have a guy who did all the talking, but
now he's just doing it on his own.
Ross: Man, I wish I was having this conversation with the manager of the woman's
store.
Phoebe: Oh, she's a manager!
Ross: Yeah.
Rachel: But, I'm not gonna call her because it's just a superficial
thing.
Phoebe: What, it doesn't even matter. You're not going to this job because
you're a woman.
Rachel: Oh, you're not getting a job because you're a woman. I am a woman.
Phoebe: Oh, no, no. I mean, I know that, but I don't want to talk about it. You know,
I don't want to be tiring of this conversation.
Rachel: No, you're not.
Phoebe: No, I am.
Rachel: Oh, you're just getting in there, aren't ya? I mean, it's not like I'm
able to get a job, I mean, I don't work nights and weekends, okay? I don't work
days of the week, okay? I get a job a couple of days a week, okay?
Phoebe: OK, I'm sorry.
Monica: OK, I'll get you a little tip. I brought extra clothes.
Phoebe: You know what, I'm gonna get you a little tip. I'm gonna take you to a different
store.
Monica: Oh, no, no, no, no. I mean, it'll be more of a restaurant than anything.
Phoebe: OK, fine. (Leaves and takes her bag.)
Monica: (realizing) I'm not wearing the clothes.
Phoebe: I know!
Monica: I'm sorry...

Phoebe: Really?
Joey: Yeah, did you ever dream that you'd be unemployed for a while?
Phoebe: Oh yeah! I mean, what do you think you're gonna do now that you've
been working for three years?

don't know. But I don't know if I want to work.

Chandler: Oh my God!
Monica: (angrily) "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I can't you just make it to the doctor's appointment, okay? I can't leave you to get the flu! I can't leave you to get the chicken pox! I can't leave you to get the yams!"
Chandler: I can't leave you to get these things!
Monica: You have no idea how much it hurts!
Chandler: Let me tell you something, how much it hurts! I used to have a friend that used to go to these doctors once in a while. I mean, when you walked in there, you looked like you were in a Chinese restaurant.
Monica: Come on, you know what? You're not going to the doctor's appointment, okay? You have no idea what it's like to have to deal with doctors there.
Chandler: What?
Monica: I had a friend that used to go to these doctors once in a while. And I mean, she used to be such a nice person, she would just sit there, you know, looking at her body, and you'd just remember that she used to be a nice, nice person.
Chandler: You have no idea what it's like to be a doctor.
Monica: (shouts to Chandler) I will! I will make it easy for you!
(She walks in, and Chandler looks at her)
Chandler: (to Monica) I won't leave you! I won't leave you! It doesn't matter to him how much money I make, he won't know, because I didn't leave him.
Monica: I won't leave you! I won't leave you! I will! I will make it so hard for you to leave, that you don't have to wonder about it, 'cause it's not about.
Chandler: All right. All right, all right, it's not about money, it's about me.
Monica: I am the only one that is missing out on this.
Chandler: Oh, that's because you're single.
Monica: Oh, that's a big deal!

Joey: Hey, if you can't stand to be around my daughter when she's having her own baby, then don't be around her when she's having another one!
Phoebe: I'd rather live on my own than have to live with her! (Joey nods in agreement.)
Joey: If you could just watch two commercials a month, I wouldn't have anything to live for!
(Chandler enters.)
Chandler: Hey, you're not gonna watch that!
Joey: (shocked) What?
Chandler: I have to go to my boss's office today.
Joey: Oh my God! I can't go! (He points to the giant cardboard cutout of Ross from the first season on his shoulder.)
Chandler: You got these!
Joey: Oh my God! I did it! I took Ross' job! He said I had to get a new job! And I said, "I'll come in one day, I'll come in tomorrow!" And he said, "You can't do that!"
Chandler: Look, I did my part! Yes, I'm going to have to bring my friends and family! But I am going to have to help me do my part! I am not going to allow the stupid, old adage, "You can't do it, you can't do it."
(The giant cutout of Ross from the first season is gone. Chandler is still in the hallway.)
Chandler: Well, this is going well. I'm going to go home and go and take a walk. I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Joey: Sure, that's great.
Chandler: Okay. (To Joey) You have to give her three times as much candy as she wants. And she's gonna want you two hours a day. (Joey takes the giant cardboard cutout of Ross from the first season and puts it in his mouth.) You've gotta give her three times as much

Chandler: But that is a good thing.
Joey: Yeah, it's good for me too, y'know, I mean, when you guys were there, I thought
that youd be able to talk about your father's suicide, but you guys were gone. And then you
got to talk about the fact that you left him, and how he just felt like a stranger and a
child. And I realized that you were the reason that you left him. And that, that
hurts me a lot. I don't know if I can express it enough, and I'm sorry. (They hug.)

Ross: Are you going to tell me that you love me?
Monica: (pause) Yeah. Im going to tell you about the time you came in for dinner with me and the time that you made me beg you not to come to dinner with me.
Ross: And that you said to me in a romantic way that if a woman asks you for something and you say nothing, that means you love her, that you just might, that's good.
Monica: Wow, you're not gonna tell me about how I was just like a stranger in the bathroom of your restaurant.
Ross: I kinda know.
Monica: Yeah, well, I would just like to say that whatever happens in hell will happen in heaven. (Ross and Monica stare at each other for a while and then look at each other.) All right, what are you going to tell her?
Ross: I think I just said we're not going to tell her.
Monica: What are you going to tell her?

Ross: Oh, yeah, but we should get a good look at the Dr. Crane we just saw.
Chandler: Oh, yeah, I think we should get a good look at the Dr. Crane we just saw.
Ross: Oh, yeah, well, that's not the point. The point is that you guys saw the
exceptionally amazing Dr. Crane.
Joey: He's a little weird.
Ross: That's okay. Just because he's weird doesn't mean he's not good.
Chandler: Oh, I like that.
Joey: Well, he's great, I mean, he's just not as good as you guys.
Chandler: I'm sorry man, I don't think he's as good as you guys.
Ross: Well, he's not as good as you guys, but he is better than you guys.
Chandler: Well, he is better than you guys!
Ross: Well, I like him, I mean, he's just not as good as you guys, y'know?
Chandler: I really like him.
Ross: So, what do you think we should get?
Chandler: Well, I think you should get him because he's pretty great.
Joey: He's good? Is it just because he's cute?
Ross: Well, I don't mean cute, I mean, I mean, I think he really should get him.
Joey: I'm sorry I can't get him.
Ross: You sure you think that's a good idea?

Monica: No, get in here!
(Chandler and Monica leave. Monica enters the hall and Chandler is standing there, looking confused. Chandler tries to speak with his mouth full.)
Monica: (panicked) What?
Chandler: I don't have a mouth.
Monica: What?
Chandler: I've been taking my morning sickness medicine, and I've got an appointment in a couple of hours.
Monica: (stops) Oh, wait! There's all this talk about you! I really don't want to have sex with you!
Chandler: What am I gonna do?
Monica: I'm not sure what to do. I'm gonna call a cab.
Chandler: Oh, yeah, and I'm gonna do it with you!

Joey: No, look, Chandler, you have to stand up.
Chandler: I'm sorry, I'm just standing here now. I can tell him. He's gonna appreciate it.
Joey: Chandler, this is the best thing that's ever happened to me. I'm sure he's gonna say, "Thank you."
Chandler: You are a wonderful person, and I will never forget what you did with Emily. I'll never forget what you did with Ross.
Joey: Thank you.
Chandler: So, I think you're gonna get him to get a divorce.
Joey: That's a good one.
Chandler: What?
Joey: Well, I've always thought that if you couldn't stand it, you'd be more likely to get the divorce.
Chandler: Wow!
Joey: Look, I'm not gonna stand here and make a big deal out Ross, I don't have any other choice. But you know what? I'm gonna do my best to-to bring you a divorce.

Monica: I know, I have! And as a friend, I will never have that kind of energy.
Chandler: Well then, will you just ride that wave and never have any of it get out of control?
Monica: I think you would. I mean, you never know when you are going to make it.
Chandler: What if I am going to do this and then I am going to do it but I have no idea?
Monica: I have no idea.
Chandler: Okay, I have no idea.
Joey: (crying) Well, you will get there.
Monica: You will. (To Chandler) Please come with me.

====================
Chandler: You gotta be kidding me. I'm never coming back to that house again.
Joey: You know what? I'm gonna call my parents tonight and we'll call our friends.
Chandler: We're not going to talk to them.
Joey: All right, we're gonna call our friends.
Chandler: Okay, you can't tell them. They are gonna hear it from us.
Joey: Yeah, yeah, and I think the reason is because I don't want them to think I'm a tragic accident victim.
Chandler: (singing) I can't believe you think this is a good time.
Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I feel like I should be with my friends. I really should be with my friends. (Pause) I should be in a club all the time.
Chandler: Okay listen, I can't do this. This is gonna be hard for you. 
Joey: Okay. (Pause) But I'll get through it. (He turns to Chandler and Monica.)
Chandler: That was really nice of you to suggest that.
Joey: Yeah, I'm sorry.
Chandler: You can keep your promise.
(Chandler leaves.)
Monica: (breaking the hug) I'm gonna miss you!
Chandler: Well, I can't do this.
Monica: Actually, I can't. I'm not going to the club.
Chandler: (pause) I'm gonna go to the game.
Monica: You're going to get through this with me.
Chandler: Okay? I need you to get through this with me.
Monica: Okay.
Chandler: Okay, I'm going to get through this.
Monica: Okay. I'm going to get through this.
Chandler: Okay.

Rachel: Oh, you know what? You're right. I'm gonna go do my best to make up for the last time.
Joey: (To Rachel) Okay, but you know what? I-I really have to talk to Chandler and Mike.
Rachel: I already talked to him. He wasn't there. I just knew that my assistant was.
Joey: I know. I'm sorry, there was a chance that maybe this was the time.
Rachel: But it was a possibility.
Joey: All right. I guess we'll see you guys at dinner.

Joey: (To Rachel) Okay, I'm gonna go talk to Chandler.
Rachel: Oh, please, Joey, I have to talk to him now.
Joey: (To Chandler) Oh, okay, I know what you want. (They hug.)
Chandler: You're going to have to promise not to look at me.
Joey: All right, I've got to go talk to him.
Chandler: Yeah, I guess that's the problem.
Joey: (To Chandler) I don't think we can do it.
Chandler: I don't think you can do it.
