# The One Where AI Generates the Script

In this notebook you will find a GPT-2 model(124M) trained over scripts from "F.R.I.E.N.D.S".
You can checkout `collect_dataset.py` which was used to gather the dialogue scripts between the characters from the show.
I am using BeautifulSoup to webscape these contents. I have used the notebook from Max Woolf for training 
this dataset.
